You’ve just signed a new contract with TerraCorp, a far-future mega-corporation that terraforms alien planets across the galaxy for human inhabitation. Under the terms of your contract, TerraCorp has given you a small fleet of vehicles and equipment and a small starter fund so that you can go off and terraform your first planet or two. 

Once you’ve successfully made a planet habitable by using various technologies to adjust the planet’s temperature, atmosphere, and water levels, TerraCorp will pay you dividends for as long as that planet remains within habitable levels. You can then use the money you make to expand your fleet and terraform new planets. The galaxy’s the limit! 

This game is based on the theme "Everything is Alive". My interpretation was to make the objective to create life (or rather, the conditions for life) on every planet in every solar system you come across. This way, "everything is alive" insofar as all once-uninhabitable planets now have life.

This is a 2D game in which most actions are performed with the mouse. Press A and D to move your camera view left and right respectively. Press tab to pull up your tablet, which has three main pages: a solar system page, a shop page, and a menu page. The solar system page contains information about the planets in your current solar system, and gives you access to a directory where you can buy access to and travel to new solar systems. The shop page is where you buy the technology you need to adjust your planet's stats to make it habitable. Use the arrows in the bottom left of the tablet to change which planet you're buying the tech for. Finally, the menu page is your typical menu screen, with buttons to either adjust settings, quit to the main menu, or return to the game.

Different technologies have different energy requirements/outputs, and affect your planet's stats in different ways. Use the icons in the shop menu and the stat bars at the top of the screen to figure out what tech a planet needs. Once your planet's stats are completely balanced (indicated by the slider hitting the middle of the bar between the two dotted lines), you will begin making money. Be careful, if your planet's stats fall out of balance again, the cash stops flowing! Once you've finally made enough to afford access to a new solar system, you can buy it in the solar system directory page in the tablet. Keep in mind that the money you have after you buy a new solar system is the money you're going to have when you enter the new solar system. Save a little more than you think you'll need!

This has been so much fun to work on, and I look forward to continuing development. My studio and I might even try to turn it into a full-fledged mobile game, stay tuned!
